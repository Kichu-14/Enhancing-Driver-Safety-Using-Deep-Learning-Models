# Enhancing-Driver-Safety-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
A real-time drowsiness detection system built using deep learning to ensure safer driving conditions by alerting drivers when signs of fatigue are detected via eye-state classification.

| File Name        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Overall.py`     | Main implementation script for the complete drowsiness detection system. Uses OpenCV, Dlib, Mediapipe, and a trained CNN model to detect eye states in real time and trigger alerts when drowsiness is detected. |
| `sample.py`      | Simplified version for testing. Focuses on real-time detection and drawing of facial and hand landmarks without applying any machine learning prediction. Useful for debugging and verifying the detection pipeline. |
| `book1.ipynb`    | Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and model development. Typically used for preprocessing data, training/testing models, and visualizing results in an interactive environment. |
